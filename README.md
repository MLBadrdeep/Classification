## Introduction
in this notebook I will do some experiments to figure out the best Machine Learning algorithm on this data and try to tune them to get highest success.
After tuning I will compare them to find best one of the following 6 models.

Data Analysis
Data visualization
Data preprocessing
Machine Learning Models

1- Logistic Regression
2- KNN
3- SVM
4- Random Forest
5- Decision Tree
6- Naive Bayes
